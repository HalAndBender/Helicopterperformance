This web application calculates various performace limitations for helicopters.

Explanation:
Helicopter performance calculations, done on paper charts provided by the
manufacturer, are time consuming and error prone. A better approach was called for:
The challenge was to reverse engineer the given charts, discover the underlying
functions and link them together. The end-result is this web-application that I wrote in Python and HTML. 
It takes the user input (current environmental conditions), performs the calculations automatically and plots the results onto the
manufacturers chart.
